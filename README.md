Kalos p2 timer for noteworthy cooldowns

## Usage

Press "p2 Start" 1 or 2 seconds after the cutscene of the dog turns completely black phasing into p2 of Kalos.

Black buttons, Bombs, Laser, Dive, FMA, and Cleanse need to be pressed at the approximate time each occurs.
White buttons are optional to adjust for timings, phase, and visuals in case of mistakes.

Bombs will most likely de-sync depending on server lag.
