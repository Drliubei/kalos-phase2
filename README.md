Phase 2 of Kalos timer for noteworthy cooldowns

## Usage

Press "P2 Start" 1 or 2 seconds after the cutscene of the dog turns completely black, phasing into p2 of Kalos.

Ideally, white buttons are never pressed. They're to adjust for timings, phase, and visuals in case of mistakes.

Black buttons, Bombs, Laser, Dive, FMA, and Cleanse should be pressed at the exact time each occurs.

Bombs will most likely de-sync depending on server lag.
