Kalos p2 timer for noteworthy cooldowns

## Usage

Press "p2 Start" 1 or 2 seconds after the cutscene of the dog turns completely black phasing into p2 of Kalos.

Black buttons, Bombs, Laser, Dive, FMA, and Cleanse need to be pressed at the exact time each occurs.
White buttons can be pressed whenever to adjust for timings, phase, and visuals.

Bombs will most likely de-sync depending on server lag.
